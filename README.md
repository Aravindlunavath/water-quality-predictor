# Water Pollutants Predictor

This is a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline that predicts the levels of various water pollutants based on **year** and **station ID**. The project is built in 3 phases:
- Week 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Week 2: Model Training
- Week 3: Streamlit Web App

##  Project Overview

Pollution in water sources is a major environmental concern. Monitoring and predicting pollutant levels can help authorities take preventive actions. This project leverages historical data to predict:
- NH₄ (Ammonium)
- BSK5
- Suspended Particles
- O₂ (Dissolved Oxygen)
- NO₃, NO₂ (Nitrates, Nitrites)
- SO₄ (Sulphates)
- PO₄ (Phosphates)
- CL (Chloride)
